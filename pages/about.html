        <p>My full name is Simon Young Jung. I'm 21 years old and am currently studying in the CIT program at BCIT. 
        I have 3 main hobbies: playing LoL, practicing piano, and finding Pusheen comics and photos. 
        I <em>love</em> Pusheen so much that I own a Pusheen-themed blanket, plushie, and keychains. However my most 
        invested hobby <strong>by far</strong> is piano, which I've been playing since I was 5. </p>
